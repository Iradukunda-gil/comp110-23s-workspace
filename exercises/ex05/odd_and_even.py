#The function name is odd_and_even and is called with a list[int] as an argument.

def odd_and_even(list1: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    new_list: list[int] = []
    
#The function should return a list[int].
#The function should return a new list containing the elements of the input list that are odd and have an even index.
#The function should not mutate (modify) the input list.
#Explicitly type variables, parameters, and return types. (The autograder won’t check for this, but it’s good practice for the quiz!)
